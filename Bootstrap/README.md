# Bootstrap.html

**Objective:** For this assignment you will create a responsive fluid web page using Twitter's Bootstrap (version 4.0.0).

- Use the starter template on [Bootstrap's website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template) as the base for your HTML file.
- Where possible use semantic tags with Bootstrap classes instead of just plain divs.  For instance, most Bootstrap examples show wrapping everything under body in a div with class container.  Instead, you can just put body in that class.
- Your html must validate as HTML5 according to the W3C Validator.  Pro Tip: If you haven't already done so, install the Brackets extension W3CValidation which will alert you when you have issues.
- You may not use LESS/SASS or mixins -- only standard CSS3.
- You must use a [fluid grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#grid).  Your page should have a heading/jumbotron that spans the full width, and then must have at least 2 columns.  The columns should fluidly change to a single column on small viewport widths.
- At least 3 uses of glyphicons.
- At least one each of Bootstrap badges (labels) and alerts.  And a total of 3 combined.
- You must have at least 3 [responsive images](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#images-respondive), that make use of at least 2 of the [image shapes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#images-shapes).
- You must also use a carousel to display at least 3 images.  You may reuse the same images from above.  You may not use the Javascript interface to the carousel -- you must use data attributes instead.
- You must have a navbar with links into your page that is fluid and ultimately closes to a single button when the viewport is small.  For example, the top image below was taken with viewport size of 1076 while the bottom image was taken with a viewport of 760.
